## Programme Duration and Role

Over the course of `one day`, I played the role of a `AWS Solutions Architect` at the `AWS Cloud Team of Architects` 

This program has enabled me to immerse myself in the day-to-day operations of a SA at AWS, actively engage with senior team members, comprehend their objectives, and produce valuable contributions to key projects. Additionally, I've honed my understanding of`Cloud Cost Management`, `System Architecture`, `Technical Communication` and adeptly build a thought processing for writing a technical email.
