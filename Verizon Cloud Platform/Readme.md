## Programme Duration and Role

Over the course of `one week`, I played the role of a `Cloud Computing Engineer` at the `Verizon Cloud Computing Team.` 

This program has enabled me to immerse myself in the day-to-day operations of a CCE at Verizon, actively engage with senior team members, comprehend their objectives, and produce valuable contributions to key projects. Additionally, I've honed my understanding of `Agile methodologies`, grasped the core aspects of `cloud-native applications`, `interacted with and tested a cloud application via Python`, and adeptly presented my findings. Moreover, I've developed a deep understanding of the **three crucial elements of cloud application security** - network, application, and data, while enhancing my ability to conduct technical research, compile insightful findings, and create impactful PowerPoint presentations.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Program Scenario

**Objective:** Thoroughly review existing product documentation and past sprint notes to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Sasha project, preparing for effective collaboration in sprint meetings and subsequent project tasks as a Cloud Computing Engineer at Verizon.

**What I learned in this task:**
- Gained an understanding of the Sasha project, its business requirements, and its role as a VPN service supporting Verizon Cloud Platform.
- Understood my responsibilities as a Cloud Computing Engineer at Verizon, including QA/testing support, maintaining test environments, and developing both manual and automated test cases.
- Learned about the Agile workflow at Verizon, preparing for stand-up and sprint planning meetings, and the importance of effective communication with both team members and external stakeholders.

ps. There was no deliverable for this task, only a set of questions and quizzes to guide my thought process.


### Task 2: Understanding the characteristics of cloud native applications

**Objective:** 
Use command line Python to run a program and use its functionality to test whether Sasha meets any of the cloud-native traits, then submit your findings against each of them.

**What I learned in this task:**
- Understood cloud-native traits like 'Redundancy', 'Resiliency' and 'Least-privilege'. Understood the foundation of what makes a good cloud application.
- Learnt basic concepts of how to test a cloud application against each of the cloud-native traits. 
- Installed and utilized Python command line tools on your computer.
- Tested the VPN service against different test cases.


### Task 3: Cloud Based Application Security

**Objective:** 
Follow the steps to explore several websites to conduct your research. Create a PowerPoint presentation using the template that summarizes your research results.

**What I learned in this task:**
- How to effectively conduct research online about securing cloud applications.
- How to demonstrate research results in a clear and effective way.

### Task 4: Recap and Reflection

**Objective:** 
Recap the understanding from the lessons so far and answer quizes related to the work performed.

**What I learned in this task:**
- Went through a revision of the Cloud Application security, Data security, and Network security
